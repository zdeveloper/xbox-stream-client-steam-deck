### Keyboard controls

The following keys are mapped as following:

    Dpad: Keypad direction controls
    Buttons: A, B, X, Y, Backspace (Mapped as B), Enter (Mapped as A)
    Nexus (Xbox button): N
    Left bumper: [
    Right bumper: ]

### Streaming stats

During the stream you can show extra debug statistics that contain extra data about the buffer queues and other information. To bring this up you have to press `~` on your keyboard.

On the left bottom you can see the status (Altough not always accurate). The right top you can find the FPS of the video and audio decoders including the latency. On the right bottom you can find debug information about the buffer queues and other information that is useful for debugging perposes.

When possible always provide this information with your issue when possible (if it is related).
### Online friends list

The application also provides a way to see which of your friends are online. This can be useful when you want to quickly check if anyone is online to play with :)

## Steam Deck

This application is reported to be working on the Steam Deck with some small bugs and side-effects.

### Fullscreen on launch

To launch the application in full-screen mode use the `--fullscreen` argument when launching the application.

### Connect on launch

To auto-connect to your xbox on launch you can provide the `--connect=F400000000000000` argument when launchng the application.

### To close the application

Click on the Xbox logo on the left top. It will ask you to confirm to close the window.

### Number input seems to be broken

This is because the Steam Deck is missing a font and falls back to a font without numbers. The numbers are still being typed but they are not visible. This issue should be solved with the latest patch (not confirmed yet)
